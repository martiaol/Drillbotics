The cost of the rig and materials for 2016-2017 Drillbotics competition is limited to US\$ 10,000. The preliminary budget is shown in table (*), where all expected materials to be purchased are listed. Components that are already owned by the university or borrowed from companies are not included in the total expenses as they are free of cost.  

As of now the total expenditures will be covered by funding from the Petroleum Institute at NTNU. However, the goal for the coming months will be to attempt to get funding from relevant technology companies. We will try to implement innovative technology inspired by other industries, which can make it possible to get in touch with a wider range of companies. This can be companies that are working with control systems, sensors, vibration analysis etc.
